technologies_short_description_elo_fimir_slave_eco_2_belakor	Most physical labour such as building is done by slaves or Shearls, the lowest cast of Fimir. Since slaves are easier to come by than new Shearls, the Fimir have become adept in catching their prey alive.	false

technologies_onscreen_name_elo_fimir_military_4_belakor	Warrior Elite	false
technologies_short_description_elo_fimir_military_4_belakor	The members of the warrior caste receive the best equipment the colony has to offer. This makes them much more dangerous in battle.	false
