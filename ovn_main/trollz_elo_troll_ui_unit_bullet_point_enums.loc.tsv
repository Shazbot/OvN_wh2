ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_horrible_stench	River Trolls stink horribly - even compared to other trolls. Even the most repulsive or strong-willed beings need to overcome their natural disgust to engage them in close combat.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_horrible_stench	Horrible Stench	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_rock_solid	Stone Trolls have hard skin which makes them very resilient against physical or magical harm. However, once it is penetrated and the Trolls feel pain, they are easy to scare off the battlefield.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_rock_solid	Stone Skin	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_death_stench	Stench of Death	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_death_stench	Other River Trolls already stink badly of rotting fish and riverbed, but Shipwreckers stink of rotting corpses, feces and waste. Even the bravest find it intolerable to stay close for long, let alone to fight efficiently.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_throgg_orders	These Trolls have been under the bosses command for a very long time already. They can follow simple orders to slightly alter their behaviour in battle. Due to their limited intelligence though, only one order per battle can be given to avoid confusion.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_throgg_orders	Bosses Orders	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_difficult_to_spot	Natural Camouflage	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_difficult_to_spot	Despite being naturally camouflaged in forests, these monsters never understood the concept of sneaking. They are still difficult to spot from afar.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_weak_regeneration	Weakened Regeneration	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_weak_regeneration	The regenerative ability of Bile Trolls is mostly occupied by keeping their many afflictions at bay. This means that wounds Bile Trolls receive are healing much slower compared to other Trolls.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_host_illnesses	Host to Terrifying Afflictions	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_host_illnesses	Just being near Bile Trolls is a terrifying experience as the many gifts of Grandfather Nurgle constantly threaten to infect everyone around, weakening and frightening closeby enemies and allies alike.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_big_angry	Reckless Rage	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_big_angry	Hurting these Trolls just makes them really angry. Not even the boss can maintain control over enraged Snow Trolls - usually it is not necessary though, since they will just pound the source of their anger into the ground.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_no_regeneration	The regenerative abilities of Lava Trolls are fully occupied, constantly repairing the damage the heat inside their bodies causes. These Trolls cannot regenerate damage received and heal as slowly as most 'normal' beings. 	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_no_regeneration	No Regeneration	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_burning_aura	Lava Trolls radiate heat. Those who come too close to engage these monsters in melee are often burned by their proximity to the Lava Trolls alone.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_burning_aura	Burning Aura	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_warpstone_solid	Somehow Warpstone has fused to the skin of these creatures, making them resilient to all types of damage. And those who feel no pain will not retreat easily - at least as long as their protective shell persists.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_warpstone_solid	Warpstone Infused Skin	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_tooltip_contaminating_attacks	The weapons made of crude, unrefined warpstone cause weird, unnatural effects on closeby targets, greatly increasing their desire to avoid being engaged in combat with monsters wielding them.	true
ui_unit_bullet_point_enums_onscreen_name_contaminating_attacks	Contaminating Attacks	true
