units_custom_battle_mounts_localised_description_arb_golden_magusarb_golden_magus_camel	Though vigorous and spry for his old age, the Golden Magus often rides to battle on one of his many camels - out of flamboyance if anything else.	true

units_custom_battle_mounts_localised_description_arb_golden_magusarb_golden_magus_skiff	Much like the Magus' infamous flagship, this enchanted skiff is proof of his mastery over the Djinn. Held "afloat" on the air by servile Lesser Tempest Djinn oarsmen, this is one of the Golden Magus' favourite ways to ride to battle. At a glance, the skiff may seem to be ineffective in battle, but it is protected by several Djinns who will fiercely defend their master.	false
