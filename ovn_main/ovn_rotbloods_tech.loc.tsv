technologies_long_description_rot_tech_mon_2	The northlands exist in the shadow of terrible energies. When the world was young, mysterious beings known only as the Old Ones sited a gateway to the stars above the world's poles. Unknown to them this portal drew other, less benevolent entities, now worshipped as the Dark Gods. A cataclysm occurred, unseen by mortal eyes, and the gateway was destroyed. But not entirely. There remains, in the farthest north, a place where all reason, all life, breaks down: the Realm of Chaos. Those strong enough to serve its fickle rulers and endure the changes it carves into living flesh share a fraction of that unearthly power, and those best suited to do so are monstrous creatures who know no other Gods and have always called the northlands home.	true

technologies_onscreen_name_rot_tech_mon_1	Baying to Morrslieb	true
technologies_long_description_rot_tech_mon_1	When the Old Ones' northern polar gateway collapsed, and the Realm of Chaos broke through, some of the arcane structures of the gates themselves intruded into the mortal realm. Star-Metal rained down and Warpstone, the lethal substance that is magic and change made manifest, came into being. A massive accretion of Warpstone formed in the sky, and became a sickly-green, weird moon, which men have named Morrslieb. Certain creatures of the north feel drawn to this corrupted moon, and when these sharp-toothed hunters bay at it, raising their heads to give blood-curdling howls in its baleful light, they feel its energy course through their flesh and sinews, urging them to greater ferocity and destruction in the name of the Dark Gods.	true

technologies_long_description_rot_nor_marauders_06	A mounted warrior has many advantages: greater speed to rush into battle, greater height to strike from, and the brute power of his mount, making him able to chase down and trample more enemies. But for the mount to be effective they must be shod, hooves hardened and protected with metal shoes that in their turn increase the steed's ability to inflict damage on those they run down. A badly-fitted shoe can be the undoing of a rider, ending their chance to bring glory and bloodshed for the Gods before the fight has even begun. A well-fitted shoe requires the right tools, wielded by experts.	true
technologies_long_description_rot_nor_marauders_05	As for a warrior, so for his steed. When a Marauder lays into his foes, his armour lets him absorb their blows and strike back without distraction. When he rides into battle, his mount must have similar protection, lest the enemy cut the beast out from under him. Covering the mount's vitals with barding protects it, so the ruthless warrior riding on its back or in the chariot behind may strike deeper into enemy lines, cutting down and trampling all who stand in his way, the better to soak the land in their blood to glorify the Gods.	true

technologies_long_description_rot_nor_other_17	Though the Vampire Counts have little in the way of plunder, their arcane knowledge may still serve the Ruinous Powers. They understand the ways of preserving and using the dead, and of raising armies that do not tire or falter, mindless warriors who will not stop until hacked into useless lumps of decaying flesh. Their lore also honours the Skin Wolves, and that knowledge is of use when dealing with the were creatures who lend their claws and fangs to the fight, and travel with the armies of the north. 	true
