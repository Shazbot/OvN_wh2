unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_plague_toads	Plague Toads, also known as Sewer-kin, are lesser demons of Nurgle. Their exact origin is unknown, but it is speculated that they may be Nurglings grown fat from filth, the remains of a Plaguebearer destroyed but not yet banished or maybe just 'natural' occuring denizens of Nurgle's gardens.	true
